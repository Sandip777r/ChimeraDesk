# HPRDP
High performance reverse SSH RDP solution (not really RDP, more like teamviewer..)

## Known Issues

- On stacking windows managers (Gnome, Plasma, ...) the window opens up with no content and therefore its size is 0. You need to enlarge the window before launching the ffmpeg process on the remote host, or the video feed will pop out of the main window, leaving the user input broken.
